	abstract = {This work deals with decentralized control of multiple nonholonomic mobile sensors for optimal coverage of a given area for sensing purposes. We assume a density function over the region to be covered, which can be viewed as a probability density of the phenomena to be sensed. The density function is unknown but assumed to be linearly parameterized with unknown parameter weights. We consider a second-order dynamic model for the mobile agents and derive decentralized adaptive control laws to achieve optimal coverage of the region. We then consider the case where the dynamic model of the agents are not fully known, and then develop parameter adaptation laws to achieve the optimal coverage objective. We test the derived algorithms using simulations and compare our proposed controllers with kinematics-based controllers. We find that the feedback control design based on the dynamic model performs significantly better than controllers solely relying on kinematic models. Furthermore, for the unknown dynamics case, our controller outperforms the nonadaptive controller with poor initial parameter estimates.},

	abstract = {Summary This paper proposes a control framework that addresses the destabilizing effect of communication time delays and system uncertainties in telerobotics, in the presence of force feedback. Force feedback is necessary to obtain transparency, which is providing the human operator as close a feel as possible of the environment where the slave robot is operating. Achieving stability and providing transparency are conflicting goals. This is the major reason why, currently, a very few, if at all, fully operational force feedback teleoperation devices exist except for research environments. The proposed framework handles system uncertainty with adaptation and communication time delays with explicit delay compensation. The technology that allows this explicit adaptive time-delay compensation is inspired by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Adaptive Posicast Controller. We provide simulation results that demonstrate stable explicit adaptive delay compensation in a force-reflecting teleoperation set up. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the miniaturization of many consumer products is extending the use of micro-milling operations with high-quality requirements. However, the impacts of cutting-tool wear on part dimensions, form and surface integrity are not negligible and part quality assurance for a minimum production cost is a challenging task. In fact, industrial practices usually set conservative cutting parameters and early cutting replacement policies in order to minimize the impact of cutting-tool wear on part quality. Although these practices may ensure part integrity, the production cost is far away to be minimized, especially in highly tool-consuming operations like mold and die micro-manufacturing. In this paper, an adaptive control optimization (ACO) system is proposed to estimate cutting-tool wear in terms of part quality and adapt the cutting conditions accordingly in order to minimize the production cost, ensuring quality specifications in hardened steel micro-parts. The ACO system is based on: (1) a monitoring sensor system composed of a dynamometer, (2) an estimation module with Artificial Neural Networks models, (3) an optimization module with evolutionary optimization algorithms, and (4) a CNC interface module. In order to operate in a nearly real-time basis and facilitate the implementation of the ACO system, different evolutionary optimization algorithms are evaluated such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GA), and simulated annealing (SA) in terms of accuracy, precision, and robustness. The results for a given micro-milling operation showed that PSO algorithm performs better than GA and SA algorithms under computing time constraints. Furthermore, the implementation of the final ACO system reported a decrease in the production cost of 12.3 and 29 \% in comparison with conservative and high-production strategies, respectively.},

	abstract = {Buck DC–DC converter is used in many applications to supply a fixed amount of DC voltage. They are highly sensitive to the frequently changing loading conditions. Such a situation demands a robust control mechanism which can guarantee satisfactory performance of the buck converter over a widely changing load. This can be made possible by developing an adaptive control scheme which can estimate the true values of the uncertain load parameters in the least possible time. This paper proposes an adaptive Chebyshev neural network (CNN) based backstepping control technique for the output voltage regulation of a DC–DC buck converter. The proposed control strategy utilizes neural networks in approximating the unknown non-linear nature of load resistance by using orthogonal basis Chebyshev polynomials. CNN approximation tool in conjunction with the conventional backstepping procedure yields a robust control mechanism. The weights of neural network are tuned online using adaptive laws satisfying the overall closed loop stability criterion in the Lyapunov sense. The performance of the proposed control is demonstrated for wide range perturbations by subjecting the buck converter to changes in load resistance, input voltage and reference output voltage. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller against radial basis function neural network based adaptive backstepping control and conventional adaptive backstepping. The results obtained are further verified from experimentation on a hardware setup using DSP based TM320F240 processor. Thus, the investigation confirms effectiveness of the proposed control scheme as the output voltage shows a fast and accurate response besides successfully rejecting the disturbances acting upon it.},

	abstract = {Load-following is the most important operation in the nuclear reactors. In the nuclear reactors, imbalance of axial power distribution induces xenon oscillations. These oscillations must be maintained bounded within acceptable limits. Otherwise, the nuclear reactor could become unstable. Therefore, bounded imbalance of axial power distribution is considered to be a restriction for the load following operation. Also, in order to design the nuclear reactor control systems, xenon concentrations and delayed neutrons precursors densities must be available. But, physical measurement of these parameters is impossible. In this paper, for the first time, in order to estimate the xenon concentrations and delayed neutrons precursors densities and ensure imbalance of axial power distribution are kept bounded within acceptable limits during Load-following operation, an Adaptive Observer based Adaptive Sliding Mode Control based on the two-point kinetics reactor model is presented. The sliding mode method exhibits acceptable tracking performance in the presence of parametric uncertainty only at the expense of high gains and control chattering. Therefore, parameter uncertainties match envisaged by designing adaptive Algorithm for both the control and observer and high chattering authority is inhibited. The adaptation laws to online parameter adaptation and observer gains adaptation are generated using the Lyapunov approach. Also, the stability analysis is given by means of Lyapunov approach, thus the system is guaranteed to be stable within a large range. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the load-following operation, in terms of the robustness and stability. Also, results show that the xenon oscillations kept bounded in the given region and the adaptive parameters are bounded during load following operation and observer follows the actual system variables accurately in the presence of the parameters uncertainties and external disturbances.},

Considering the adverse effects of asymmetric and rate-dependent hysteresis nonlinearities, a polynomial-based rate-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is first developed to characterize their behaviors, and inverse model based compensation is also constructed. Furthermore, the resulting inverse compensation error is analytically given, and a novel disturbance observer with adaptive control techniques is designed to handle the bounded disturbances, including the inverse compensation error and the high-order matched and mismatched disturbances. Comparative experiments on a multiaxis nano servo stage are finally conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control architecture, where substantial performance improvement over existing results are achieved on various tracking scenarios.},

In this paper, adaptive piecewise linear switch controller is proposed for improving the response time and tracking performance of the hydraulic actuator control system, which is essentially piecewise linear. The controller composed of PID and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) adaptively chooses the proportion of these two components and makes the designed system have faster response time at the transient phase and better tracking performance, simultaneously. Then, their stability and tracking performance are analyzed and evaluated by the hydraulic actuator control system, the hydraulic actuator is controlled by the electrohydraulic system, and its model is built, which has piecewise linear characteristic. Then the controller results are compared between PID and MRAC and the switch controller designed in this paper is applied to the hydraulic actuator; it is obvious that adaptive switch controller has better effects both on response time and on tracking performance.},
